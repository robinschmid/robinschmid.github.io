Meet me, Corinna Brungs, and others on our Computational Mass Spectrometry Seminar Europe Tour 2023 and learn about: Mass Spectrometry Basics, Data Processing, Compound Annotation, Automated Spectral Library Generation, Molecular Networking, microbeMASST & MZmine.     
Next stop: [Munich Metabolomics Meeting](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/munich-metabolomics-meeting-2023/program) @Helmholtz Munich  

Join our project **FAIRification of mass spectral libraries** at the Elixir BioHackathon in Barcelona (online/in person).

## About

I am a food chemist and PhD in analytical chemistry working as a postdoctoral researcher in **Computational Mass Spectrometry**. After coming back to Europe from a postdoc in Pieter Dorrestein's group at UC San Diego, I am now in Prague, working at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Tomáš Pluskal's group that focuses on **Plant Specialized Metabolism**.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **mass spectrometry** (MS), **metabolomics**, and **data science**. I have always been fascinated by the analytical power of modern mass spectrometry, especially for non-target analysis and the discovery and elucidation of small molecules (<2000 Da) in complex samples. My food and analytical chemistry background gave me the technical skills and hands-on experience with high-end molecular and elemental mass spectrometry instruments that supported my scientific projects. In my research, I combine this practical knowledge with my passion for data science and programming to create new analytical methods, along with computational MS algorithms and open-source software.

Since 2019, I have led the [MZmine](https://www.mzmine.org/) open-source project as its chief architect. MZmine reached its status as one of the most cited mass spectrometry and metabolomics tools by its ease of use, processing speeds, and interactive user interfaces. Further, we expanded its capabilities by developing a workflow for **integrative analysis of multimodal mass spectrometry data**, combining LC-IMS-MS and IMS-MS imaging in the same tool.
